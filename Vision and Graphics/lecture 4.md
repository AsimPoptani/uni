## Epipolar Geometry
2 cameras which are relativly close together which can pinpoint an image in 3D. 
These 2 images have points which can be matched to a point `P` on the real object. A vector is then calculated `Pl` and `Pr` (point Left and Point right). You then have Epipoles which are a normal to the vector. 

You can have Epipoles which
