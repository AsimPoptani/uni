## Phtotmetric Image Formation

### Types of sensors
- CCD
  - Uses a photodiode and a photomultipliers
  - photodiodes 
    - Used to dectect light
  - Photomultipliers
    - Used to detect weak light 
- Infa-red
  - Uses a CCD
- Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
  - Radar based antennae
- Range sensor
  - Laser based (think unltrasonic )
- MRI
- PET/CAT
  
### Quick and nasty experiment to test for IR filter
- Get remote fire into phone
