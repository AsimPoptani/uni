## Formatives 
Aut Week 9 

## Grades

### Open Coursework (This is usually done extreamly well)
Spring Week 8 - Week 10 on Part 1 Weight 50%

### Close Exam (Part 2 is done crappy)
Summer Week 5-7 
Part 1 and 2 Weighting 50%

## Strategy
Get close to full marks on coursework as possible. Know and understand 80 % of the exam so can spend time on other more important exams. This means you can write of 20% if you can nail the open coursework.

#### The killer in the exam is that the technical language used was shit. Used the right technical exams.
